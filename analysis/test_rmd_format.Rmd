## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

- <input type="checkbox" unchecked> Venus</input>
- <input type="checkbox" checked> Mars</input>

Figures to make:
1. Placeholder, Nascent RNA reveals abundance of NMD-destined transcripts
2.	sQTLs, eQTLs
b.	Enrichment of annotations in transcriptional vs post-transcriptional eQTLs. Classify transcriptional vs post-transcriptional by comparing hQTL to eQTL significance (or effect size).
c.	QQ-plot of eQTL signal, grouped by hQTLs, sQTLs that affect productive junctions, and sQTLs that affect unproductive junctions
d.	polyA sQTL beta vs polyA eQTL beta scatter, faceted by stable vs unstable.
e.	Beta vs beta spearman slope with different lines for chRNA, 4sU, polyA, faceted by stable vs unstable
3.	Contribution of splicing-mediated decay to complex trait
a.	A single GWAS trait (ie MS) QQ plot, colored by splicing-mediated eQTLs, transcription-mediated QTLs, productive-AS sQTLs
