## Intro

Quinn asked me for code and data for a scatter plot I made for Yang that I can't find anymore. I'll recreate something like it here:

## code

Load libs

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
```

I previously created "long format" junction count tables for naRNA-seq and steady-state, and another file for the previously published NMD knockdown experiment (Karousis et al)... Read in those files

```{r}

juncs.long <- fread("../code/SplicingAnalysis/CombinedJuncTables/All.tsv.gz")

dat.KD <- fread("/project2/yangili1/cfbuenabadn/ChromatinSplicingQTLs/code/SplicingAnalysis/CombinedJuncTables/NMD_KD.tsv.gz")

juncs.long <- bind_rows(juncs.long, dat.KD)

juncs.long %>%
    distinct(Dataset, IndID)
```
